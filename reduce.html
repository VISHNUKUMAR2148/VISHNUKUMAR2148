		<h4> RECYCLE </h4>
		<ul>Recycling (and composting) This enables the materials you throw away to be used again by making them into new products.</ul>
		<ol>The best way to manage waste is to not produce it. This can be done by shopping carefully and being aware of a few guidelines:</ol>
		<li>Buy products in bulk. Larger, economy-size products or ones in concentrated form use less packaging and usually cost less per ounce.</li>
		<li>Avoid over-packaged goods, especially ones packed with several materials such as foil, paper, and plastic. They are difficult to recycle, plus you pay more for the package.</li>
		<li>Consider purchasing recycled materials at work when purchasing material for office supply, office equipment or manufacturing.</li>
		<li>Speak to store managers and ask for products and packaging that help cut down on waste, such as recycled products and products that are not over packaged.</li>
		<li>Buy products made from material that is collected for recycling in your community.</li>
		<li>Use recycled paper for letterhead, copier paper and newsletters.</li>
