		<h4> RECYCLE </h4>
		<ul>Recycling (and composting) This enables the materials you throw away to be used again by making them into new products.</ul>
		<ol>Recycling is a series of steps that takes a used material and processes, remanufactures, and sells it as a new product. Begin recycling at home and at work:</ol>
		<li>Buy products made from recycled material. Look for the recycling symbol or ask store managers or salesmen. The recycling symbol means one of two things â€“ either the product is made of recycled material, or the item can be recycled. For instance, many plastic containers have a recycling symbol with a numbered code the identifies what type of plastic resin it is made from. However, just because the container has this code does not mean it can be easily recycled locally.</li>
		<li>Check collection centers and curbside pickup services to see what they accept, and begin collecting those materials. These can include metal cans, newspapers, paper products, glass, plastics and oil.</li>
		<li>Consider purchasing recycled materials at work when purchasing material for office supply, office equipment or manufacturing.</li>
		<li>Speak to store managers and ask for products and packaging that help cut down on waste, such as recycled products and products that are not over packaged.</li>
		<li>Buy products made from material that is collected for recycling in your community.</li>
		<li>Use recycled paper for letterhead, copier paper and newsletters.</li>
